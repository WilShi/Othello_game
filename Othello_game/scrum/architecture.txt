# Use this to outline your architecture, list the design patterns
# you used in your code and how you used them. Use a few as appropriate
# to make your code better, using them to complicate code will not help
# your marks. Start by looking at the design patterns we covered in class.

# USED Design Patterns:

1. Observer/Observable : Created by arnold, to be used by the View to observe the Model.
	classes using the design pattern:
		Observer:
			- Grid
			- Undo Button
			- TokenNumLabel
			- TokenNumVBox
			- TimerSingleton
			- TimeSetter
			
		Observable:
			- Othello
2. Singleton : 
	GameMode: Used to keep track of the game mode. Can be used in othello to set the opponent to an AI.
	Timer: Used to keep a timer on each player
	classes using the design pattern:
		- TimerSingleton
		- GameModeSingleton
		- Othello
3. Visitor :

	classes using the design pattern:
		-
